Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
answer: The difference between different selector types is how wide spanning the selections are and how much code and web design is affected by the selector. One selector type may be chosen over another when developers want to isolate or accentuate certain parts of their website. 

Discuss your color palette. How did you choose your colors?
answer: I chose these colors based off of the inspiration from a KATYA album, "Vampire Fitness". The album cover has various pop culture and art history references and has a more gothic and baroque art style. The album cover itself is somewhat visceral but communicates KATYA's vision for the debut album.
